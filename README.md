Reinforcement Learning is an exciting field of Machine Learning that’s attracting a lot of attention and popularity. An important reason for this popularity is due to breakthroughs in Reinforcement Learning where computer algorithms such as Alpha Go and OpenAI Five have been able to achieve human level performance on games such as Go and Dota 2. One of the core concepts in Reinforcement Learning is the Deep Q-Learning algorithm. Naturally, a lot of us want to learn more about the algorithms behind these impressive accomplishments. In this tutorial, we’ll be sharing a minimal Deep Q-Network implementation (minDQN) meant as a practical guide to help new learners code their own Deep Q-Networks.

CART POLE PROBLEM

CartPole problem is the problem of balancing the CartPole. CartPole is the structure where a pole is attached to the cart and the cart is free to slide across the frictionless surface. By sliding the cart left or right, the CartPole is balanced.

Objective
So, the objective of the CartPole is to keep it from falling or moving out of the range. Therefore, the failure conditions are:
1. Magnitude of the angle of the pole with respect to the vertical exceeding some threshold.
2. Distance of the CartPole from the center exceeding some threshold.
To keep the CartPole continuing on for infinitely many steps, we limit the number of steps to some value (393 in my case).
